# API Basejump: Build a Nightlife Coordination App

A NodeJS App that uses the Yelp API. The app allows for users to search for bars in their area and they can indicate if they are going to there.

You can view the live demo here: https://aqueous-hollows-27026.herokuapp.com/

### The Web App Does the Following:
* As an unauthenticated user, I can view all bars in my area.
* As an authenticated user, I can add myself to a bar to indicate I am going there tonight.
* As an authenticated user, I can remove myself from a bar if I no longer want to go there.
* As an unauthenticated user, when I login I should not have to search again.
